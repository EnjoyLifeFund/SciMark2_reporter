SciMark 2.0 is a Java benchmark for scientific and numerical computing. It measures several computational [kernels](about.html) and reports a composite score in approximate Mflops (Millions of floating point operations per second). You can **[run](run.html)** the benchmark directly from your browser, or [download](download.html) the class files and Java source codes to run SciMark 2.0 on a separate Java environment. Afterwards, you may want to submit the results to our [database](/cgi-bin/ScimarkSummary) of existing scores.
